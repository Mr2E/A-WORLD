Em-Tare is the progenitor of this world. 
He is represented as several overlapping black and white fields, although this was his original form, as he currently is now in the form of the sun.
Em-Tare is a benevolent being, although still prone to his emotions, and often communicats with his followers (how he does this will be explained later).
He is sometimes called 'The Imbere' with the word Imbere having no direct translation, but roughly correlates to the concept of contrast.
As a whole, Em-Tare knows that he inhabits a much vaster universe, but often iterates that he wishes not to think on it as it is 'inherently incomprehensible' and will only lead to dissastisfaction.
