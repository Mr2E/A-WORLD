The world, Ares (Not related to the greek god) is the centre of A-World.
It was created during the earliest days of Em-Tare's existence, when he first began to ponder on his exsistence.
Finding nothing, but dissatisfaction to try and understand what he calls, the incomprehensible, the dissatisfacton took root and made the first vestige (explained later)
This vestige was rejected from his body and shot out, forming what would eventually become ARES.
Em-Tare spent much time studying this new world and would eventually visit it.
