When Em-Tare first found Ares, it was a dark and strange place, formed from the fear of unknowing.
Curious to explore this strange vestige, Em-Tare seperated a part of himself (soon to be simply called, The Child,  or Ek).
The Child descended onto Ares, leaving behind him a trail of light (Known as the Child's Path, this trail looks like the Milky Way).
Upon contact, the Child immediately noticed the many strange forms that began emerging from whenever he stepped. 
Curious, Em-Tare asked the Child to dive into the earth, noticing the strange forms himself.
Upon diving into the earth, to Em-Tare's suprise instead of various creatures spilling forth, a single large mass formed and shot into the sky. 
This, large white mass, now known as Ekares (Child of Ares), became the moon, one of the first, and quite possibly the largest single lifeform.
Seeing this, Em-Tare instead decided to send forth much of his outer body, which fell across Ares and established the first proper life.
